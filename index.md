# Welcome to my Portfolio
### About Me
 My name is **Joseph Moore** and I am currently a Sophomore student at Boise State University hoping to major in computer science and minor in mathematics. Some things I enjoy doing in my spare time include rock climbing, playing the piano, and of course coding! I originally had my first introduction into the field of computer science all the way back in 4th grade when I signed up to join a lego robotics team in the FLL (First Lego League) where we used some block programing and sensors on the robot we built to help it move around and complete its various objectives. From there I became interested in a website called [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) where I was able to code a variety of different games. Later in high school, I took an introductory computer science course where I finaly discovered that this was the career I wanted to pursue in college taking various other courses at my high school (that were concurrent credit for BSU) where I finaly ended up where I am now.

### Projects

#### High School Projects

* This is a [frogger game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/92971701/) I made in Scratch as one of the final projects for one of my introductory courses in high school.

* This is a [tank game](https://github.com/josephmoore99/Tank-Game) that I made back in high school and was one of the first JavaScript projects I completed.

#### Boise State Projects

* CS221
  * [Circuit Tracer](https://github.com/josephmoore99/Circuit-Tracer) is a simple pathfinding program implemented using stacks and queues
