# Welcome to my Portfolio
### About Me
 My name is **Joseph Moore** and I am currently a Senior at Boise State University hoping to major in computer science and minor in mathematics. Some things I enjoy doing in my spare time include rock climbing, playing the piano, and of course coding! I originally had my first introduction into the field of computer science all the way back in 4th grade when I signed up to join a lego robotics team in the FLL (First Lego League) where we used some block programing and sensors on the robot we built to help it move around and complete its various objectives. From there I became interested in a website called [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) where I was able to code a variety of different games. Later in high school, I took an introductory computer science course where I finaly discovered that this was the career I wanted to pursue in college taking various other courses at my high school (that were concurrent credit for BSU) where I finally ended up at BSU.

At BSU, my love for the field continued to grow as I was able to go deeper into some new and more intriguing programming concepts and algorithms. One of the areas I found a lot if interest in is working with large amounts of data and artificial intelligence. As it stands, I have been able to make it onto the Dean's list every semester and continue to maintain a 4.0 GPA. Below are some of the projects I have worked on throughout my schooling.
